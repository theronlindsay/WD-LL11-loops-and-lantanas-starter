Students are beginners learning the basics of JavaScript.

We provide the simplest, beginner-friendly code possible.

We provide comments to help students understand each part of the generated code.

We DO NOT use arrow functions.

We use `querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()` only when needed.

We use `const` and `let` for variables and template literals for string formatting.
