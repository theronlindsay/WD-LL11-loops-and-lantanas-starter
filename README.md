# 🌼 Loops & Lantanas – Dev Lab Challenge

## 🎓 About This Project

This activity is part of the **Global Career Accelerator – Coding for Web** course.  
You’ll be using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AI tools** to explore how loops, arrays, and functions drive real-world user interactions.

In this **Dev Lab simulation**, your team will enhance a fictional park directory for **The Lantana Alliance**, a nonprofit that maintains public cooling stations in the Inland Empire.  
You’ll use AI to help refactor code, debug broken features, and build new functionality using JavaScript fundamentals.

## 🧠 What You’ll Be Doing

In this lab, you'll simulate working in a **JavaScript-powered Dev Team**.  
Your job? Refactor and build features for a web page that lists local cooling stations — and practice using **AI like a co-coder**.

You’ll practice:
- Writing and editing JavaScript functions
- Using loop types like `for`, `map`, `forEach`, and `while`
- Prompting AI (like ChatGPT or Copilot) to refactor or debug
- Collaborating in teams to build real features

This site includes:

- ✅ A broken **addStations()** function ready to be debugged
- 🧠 Suggested feature prompts for team builds
- 📹 A short explainer video challenge to showcase your work

## 🧪 Getting Started

Open this project in **GitHub Codespaces** or your local editor. 

### Files to Edit

- `index.html` — structure for the park and feature content
- `style.css` — styles for layout, sections, and visual polish
- `script.js` — where you’ll write JavaScript and fix broken code
- `dom.js` — rendering functions you’ll call from your logic

> 💡 Use the `// TODO:` comments in `script.js` to guide your edits.

## ⚙️ How This Repo Is Organized

| Folder/File | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `index.html` | Layout structure with placeholder sections |
| `style.css` | Clean layout and simple visual polish |
| `script.js` | Scaffolded JS file with function placeholders |
| `dom.js` | Contains pre-written DOM rendering helpers |
| `data.js` | Includes park data for rendering (stations, wishlist items) |
| `assets/park.jpg` | Background image for the main visual section |

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Team Feature Options

Your team will work on **one** of these challenges:

| **Task Name** | **What It Does** |
|---------------|------------------|
| 🔁 Refactor `addStations()` | Rebuild the station loop using `.map()` and `.reverse()` |
| 💌 Render Wishlist Items | Create a function to render wishlist supplies |
| ❌ Handle Search Failures | Show a message when no station matches search |
| 🌟 Featured Station Picker | Randomly pick and display one “highlighted” station |
| 🏙️ Group by City | List stations grouped under each city name |
| 🔄 Filter Toggle | Add a button to switch between filtered/unfiltered results |

> Use the LiveLab Resource Doc for AI prompt suggestions and reference functions.

## 🛠 Updated Team Feature Sections in HTML

Each of the following sections is labeled in `index.html`:

| Section ID | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `station-list` | Main station list injected by `addStations()` |
| `wishlist` | Wishlist items rendered by `renderWishlist()` |
| `featured-station` | Highlights a random featured station |
| `search-feedback` | Error message when search returns nothing |
| `grouped-stations` | Groups stations under city names |
| `toggle-controls` | Hosts a button to toggle filtered results |

## 🌱 Who Are the Lantana Alliance?

Lantana Alliance is a fictional public health nonprofit.  
Their mission: help residents stay cool during heatwaves by providing accessible misting stations and wishlist items at local parks.

- 🧊 **Focus:** Cooling station access + emergency supply distribution  
- 🗺️ **Area:** Inland Empire, California  
- 💬 **Communication:** Bi-lingual, simple, accessible design  
- 📦 **Wishlist:** Umbrellas, hats, fans, misting kits  

Your goal is to help them get this website working — so the community can access the info they need most.

## 🤖 Tips for Working with AI

- Be specific: “Rewrite this `for` loop using `forEach()`”
- Ask for explanation: “Why is this loop crashing?”
- Request help: “Suggest a function to group stations by city”
- Use browser dev tools and console logs to test small chunks
- Don’t be afraid to tweak the AI output before using it!

Happy coding! 🌼
